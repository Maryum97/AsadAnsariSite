## About This Repository

As a web developer for Mayfair IT Consultacy, I was assigned the task of developing a webpage for the Manager and Director of the organisation, Mr Asad Ansari. Being well-versed with HTML and CSS, I decided to take up this project and use the very robust and reliable React.js technology to develop the UI/UX for this webpage.

This project was successfully completed within 2 months, and the webpage was deployed on Heroku. Below is a short demo:
